Duhram sits on the territory of several Native nations, including the Tutelo and Saponi speaking peoples. We acknowledge, respect, and thank the tribes on whose stolen land we are guests.

Indigenous people are not relics of the past. We who work and live here must acknowledge past violence and ongoing harm produced by the ongoing effects of colonization.

-   The researcher is the primary instrument for data collection and data analysis

-   The analysis seeks to find emerging themes

-   The product of a qualitative study is richly descriptive

Read through the dialogue on the back page of the handout. Cfonsider how students are using language to:

-   Build community and / or collaboration
-   Position (mathematical) thinking as significant

## Discorse Analysis

> Discourse Analysis is the study of language (structure, form, and syntax) together with the study of "language-in-use... \[where we study\] language in terms of actual utterances or sentences in speech or writing in specific contexts of speaking and hearing or writing and reading... Discourse allows us to create and enact our identities" [@gee, p. 19-20].
